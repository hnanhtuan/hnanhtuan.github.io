abstract = "We introduce a novel approach to improve unsupervised hashing. Specifically, we propose a very efficient embedding method: <strong>Gaussian Mixture Model embedding (Gemb)</strong>. The proposed method, using Gaussian Mixture Model, embeds feature vector into a low-dimensional vector and, simultaneously, enhances the discriminative property of features before passing them into hashing. Our experiment shows that the proposed method boosts the hashing performance of many state-of-the-art, e.g. Binary Autoencoder (BA), Iterative Quantization (ITQ), in standard evaluation metrics for the three main benchmark datasets."
